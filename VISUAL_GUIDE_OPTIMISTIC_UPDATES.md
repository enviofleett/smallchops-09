# Visual Guide: Before vs After Optimistic Updates

## Before Implementation (Old Behavior)

```
Timeline of Order Status Update:

T=0s    User clicks "Update Status" button
        ↓
        Button shows spinner
        UI is FROZEN at old status
        User waits...
        ↓
T=1-3s  Server processes request
        ↓
        Server responds
        ↓
        Query invalidation triggered
        ↓
        UI refetches data
        ↓
T=3-5s  UI FINALLY updates to show new status
        Success toast appears

Total wait time: 3-5 seconds
User experience: Laggy, unresponsive
```

### Error Scenario (Old)
```
T=0s    User clicks "Update Status" button
        ↓
T=1-3s  Server request fails
        ↓
        Error toast appears
        UI still shows old status (good)
        No additional rollback needed (already showing correct state)

Issue: Long wait before user knows about error
```

---

## After Implementation (New Behavior)

```
Timeline of Order Status Update:

T=0s    User clicks "Update Status" button
        ↓
        UI IMMEDIATELY updates to new status
        Button shows spinner (brief)
        User sees instant feedback ✓
        ↓
T=0s    Server request sent in background
        ↓
T=1-3s  Server responds successfully
        ↓
        Forced refetch confirms state
        Success toast appears
        UI remains at new status (confirmed)

Total visible wait: ~0 seconds (instant update)
Background sync: 1-3 seconds
User experience: Fast, responsive, native-like
```

### Error Scenario (New)
```
T=0s    User clicks "Update Status" button
        ↓
        UI IMMEDIATELY updates to new status
        User sees instant feedback
        ↓
T=0s    Server request sent in background
        ↓
T=1-3s  Server request fails
        ↓
        UI AUTOMATICALLY reverts to old status
        Error toast appears
        User understands failure occurred

User sees: Quick flash of new status → reverts → error message
User experience: Clear feedback, proper error handling
```

## Visual Comparison

### Scenario 1: Successful Update

**BEFORE:**
```
[Old Status: Pending]  →  [Loading...]  →  [Wait...]  →  [Wait...]  →  [New Status: Confirmed]
     0s                      1s              2s            3s               4s
```

**AFTER:**
```
[Old Status: Pending]  →  [New Status: Confirmed]  →  [Confirmed ✓]
     0s                      0s (instant!)              1-3s (background sync)
```

### Scenario 2: Failed Update

**BEFORE:**
```
[Old Status: Pending]  →  [Loading...]  →  [Wait...]  →  [ERROR]  →  [Old Status: Pending]
     0s                      1s              2s            3s            3s
```

**AFTER:**
```
[Old Status: Pending]  →  [New Status: Confirmed]  →  [Old Status: Pending] + ERROR
     0s                      0s (instant!)              1-3s (rollback)
```

## UI States

### Before (Old Implementation)
1. **Idle**: Shows current status
2. **Loading**: Shows spinner, old status visible
3. **Success**: Shows new status after delay
4. **Error**: Shows old status with error message

### After (New Implementation)
1. **Idle**: Shows current status
2. **Optimistic**: Shows new status immediately
3. **Confirming**: Background sync (may show subtle indicator)
4. **Confirmed**: Shows new status with confirmation
5. **Rollback**: Reverts to old status on error

## Code Changes Summary

### useSimpleStatusUpdate.ts
```typescript
// OLD: Simple invalidate after success
onSuccess: () => {
  queryClient.invalidateQueries(...);
}

// NEW: Optimistic update + forced refetch + rollback
onMutate: async (variables) => {
  // Cancel queries
  // Snapshot state
  // Update cache immediately
  return context;
}
onSuccess: () => {
  queryClient.refetchQueries(...); // Forced sync
}
onError: (error, variables, context) => {
  // Restore from snapshot
  queryClient.setQueryData(..., context.previousData);
}
```

### useProductionStatusUpdate.ts
- Same pattern as useSimpleStatusUpdate.ts
- Maintains all existing error handling
- Maintains all existing logging
- Maintains circuit breaker functionality

## Real-World Example
