# User Deletion Implementation Summary

## Overview
This PR implements permanent deletion of 9 specified user accounts from the system, along with all their associated data.

## Problem Statement
Delete these users permanently:
- ulekeji2900@gmail.com
- emebassey20120@gmail.com
- toyintheophilus01@gmail.com
- akomhelen@gmail.com
- maryaustinokoro@gmail.com
- account@startersmallchops.com
- emmanuelaudokw@gmail.com
- beenfacoo@gmail.com
- maryqueenrita@gmail.com

## Solution Approach

### Leveraged Existing Infrastructure
The implementation uses the existing `recover_customer_email()` function (defined in migration `20250802111231_cc2310e1-ec9f-4dfd-9e3e-48cf6ef11e90.sql`) which provides comprehensive user data cleanup.

### What Gets Deleted
For each user, the following data is removed:
1. **auth.users** - Authentication credentials
2. **profiles** - User profile information  
3. **customer_accounts** - Customer account linkage
4. **customers** - Customer records
5. **customer_favorites** - Saved favorites
6. **customer_notification_preferences** - Notification settings
7. **customer_delivery_preferences** - Delivery preferences
8. **communication_events** - All communication history
9. **email_suppression_list** - Email suppression entries

Plus all cascade-deleted related data via foreign key constraints.

## Files Added

### 1. supabase/migrations/20251014134337_delete_specified_users.sql
**Purpose**: Primary deletion migration

**Key Features**:
- Loops through all 9 email addresses
- Calls `recover_customer_email()` for each user
- Exception handling per user (one failure doesn't stop others)
- Detailed logging via RAISE NOTICE
- Idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

**Code Structure**:
```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
  user_emails TEXT[] := ARRAY[...];
  email TEXT;
  v_result JSONB;
BEGIN
  FOREACH email IN ARRAY user_emails
  LOOP
    BEGIN
      SELECT public.recover_customer_email(email) INTO v_result;
      RAISE NOTICE 'Deleted user: % - Result: %', email, v_result;
    EXCEPTION
      WHEN OTHERS THEN
        RAISE NOTICE 'Error deleting user %: %', email, SQLERRM;
    END;
  END LOOP;
  RAISE NOTICE 'User deletion completed';
END $$;
```

### 2. supabase/migrations/20251014134338_verify_user_deletion.sql
**Purpose**: Verification script to confirm deletions

**Key Features**:
- Checks auth.users, customers, and profiles tables
- Reports status for each email address
- Provides summary (SUCCESS or INCOMPLETE)
- Can be run independently to check deletion status

**Output Example**:
```
NOTICE:  Starting verification of user deletion...
NOTICE:  ================================================
NOTICE:  DELETED: ulekeji2900@gmail.com
NOTICE:  DELETED: emebassey20120@gmail.com
...
NOTICE:  ================================================
NOTICE:  SUCCESS: All users have been deleted
```

### 3. USER_DELETION_GUIDE.md
**Purpose**: Complete documentation for applying migrations

**Sections**:
- Users to be deleted (with full list)
- Migration files explanation
- How to apply (Supabase Dashboard and CLI methods)
- Expected output examples
- Audit trail information
- Rollback warnings
- Safety measures

### 4. DELETION_SUMMARY.md (this file)
**Purpose**: Technical implementation summary

## Audit Trail
All deletions are logged in the `audit_logs` table:
- **action**: `email_recovery_completed`
- **category**: `Customer Management`  
- **message**: Details about deleted user and cleanup
- **new_values**: JSON with email and cleanup count

Example audit log entry:
```json
{
  "action": "email_recovery_completed",
  "category": "Customer Management",
  "message": "Recovered email for re-registration: ulekeji2900@gmail.com",
  "new_values": {
    "email": "ulekeji2900@gmail.com",
    "cleanup_count": 1
  }
}
```

## Safety Measures

### Data Integrity
- Uses existing, tested `recover_customer_email()` function
- Wrapped in exception handlers
- Transactional (each user deletion is atomic)
- Detailed logging for audit trail

### Idempotency
- Safe to run multiple times
- Function checks if data exists before deletion
- No errors if user already deleted

### Verification
- Separate verification script provided
- Checks multiple tables for complete cleanup
- Clear success/failure reporting

## How to Apply

### Recommended: Via Supabase Dashboard
1. Log into Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy contents of `20251014134337_delete_specified_users.sql`
4. Execute the script
5. Review NOTICE messages
6. Run verification script to confirm

### Alternative: Via Supabase CLI
```bash
cd /path/to/smallchops-09
supabase db push
```

## Rollback Considerations

⚠️ **This deletion is PERMANENT and IRREVERSIBLE**

No automatic rollback is possible. If users need to be restored:
- They must re-register as new users
- All previous data will be lost:
  - Order history
  - Preferences
  - Communication history
  - Favorites

## Testing

### Pre-Deployment Testing
- ✅ SQL syntax validated
- ✅ Function existence confirmed (`recover_customer_email` exists)
- ✅ Migration file naming follows convention
- ✅ Exception handling verified
- ✅ Logging mechanisms in place

### Post-Deployment Verification
Run verification script:
```sql
-- Execute 20251014134338_verify_user_deletion.sql
```

Check audit logs:
```sql
SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
WHERE action = 'email_recovery_completed' 
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## Impact Analysis

### Before Migration
- 9 user accounts exist (may be incomplete/orphaned)
- May have associated customer data
- May have communication history

### After Migration
- All 9 users completely removed
- Email addresses available for re-registration
- All associated data cleaned up
- Audit trail preserved

## Related Migrations

### Dependencies
This migration depends on:
- `20250802111231_cc2310e1-ec9f-4dfd-9e3e-48cf6ef11e90.sql` - Defines `recover_customer_email()` function

### Conflicts
This migration may conflict with:
- `20251014110021_eab98362-ef55-45aa-a26c-fc195b9f7fc8.sql` - Was restoring some of these users (ran earlier today)

The deletion migration takes precedence as it represents the latest requirement.

## Minimal Change Approach

This implementation follows the "minimal change" principle:
- ✅ Reuses existing `recover_customer_email()` function
- ✅ No new functions or procedures created
- ✅ No schema changes required
- ✅ Uses standard migration pattern
- ✅ Leverages existing audit logging
- ✅ No application code changes needed

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a safe, auditable, and comprehensive solution for permanently deleting the specified users while:
- Maintaining data integrity
- Providing clear audit trail
- Including verification mechanisms
- Following established patterns
- Requiring minimal code changes
