## üîß Technical Details

### Database Operations
- **Tables Modified**: 9+ tables (via cascades)
- **Rows Deleted**: Varies per user (all associated data)
- **Transaction Safety**: ‚úÖ Yes
- **Rollback Support**: ‚ùå No (permanent deletion)
- **Cascade Deletes**: ‚úÖ Automatic via FK constraints

### Data Removal Scope
Each user deletion removes:
- 1 record from `auth.users`
- 1 record from `profiles`
- 0-1 records from `customer_accounts`
- 0-1 records from `customers`
- 0-N records from `customer_favorites`
- 0-N records from `customer_notification_preferences`
- 0-N records from `customer_delivery_preferences`
- 0-N records from `communication_events`
- 0-1 records from `email_suppression_list`
- Plus all cascade-deleted related data

### Performance
- **Estimated Runtime**: < 10 seconds for all 9 users
- **Database Lock**: Minimal (row-level locks only)
- **Impact on Users**: None (these accounts will be deleted)
- **Rollback Time**: N/A (no automatic rollback)

## üîê Security & Compliance

### Audit Trail
- ‚úÖ All deletions logged in `audit_logs` table
- ‚úÖ Timestamp recorded
- ‚úÖ Action type: `email_recovery_completed`
- ‚úÖ Category: `Customer Management`
- ‚úÖ Details include email and cleanup count

### Data Protection
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive data removal (GDPR compliant)
- ‚úÖ No orphaned records left behind
- ‚úÖ Email addresses freed for re-registration
- ‚úÖ Communication history cleaned

### Safety Measures
- ‚úÖ Exception handling per user
- ‚úÖ Non-blocking (one failure doesn't stop others)
- ‚úÖ Detailed logging for debugging
- ‚úÖ Verification script included
- ‚úÖ Idempotent (safe to re-run)

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
- [x] Supabase project access
- [x] Admin/Owner permissions
- [x] SQL Editor access OR Supabase CLI installed

### Deployment Steps

#### Option A: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)
1. Open Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Execute `20251014134337_delete_specified_users.sql`
4. Review output logs
5. Execute `20251014134338_verify_user_deletion.sql`
6. Confirm success message

#### Option B: Supabase CLI
```bash
cd /path/to/smallchops-09
supabase db push
```

### Post-Deployment
1. Check audit logs:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM audit_logs 
   WHERE action = 'email_recovery_completed' 
   AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
   ```

2. Verify user count reduction:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM auth.users;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles;
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;
   ```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| User doesn't exist | Low | Low | Exception handling (logs warning, continues) |
| Function not found | Very Low | High | Pre-verified function exists in migration |
| Network timeout | Very Low | Low | Retry mechanism (idempotent) |
| Wrong user deleted | Very Low | Critical | Manual review of user list before execution |
| Data loss | N/A | N/A | Intentional (permanent deletion required) |

---

## üìû Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Function recover_customer_email does not exist"
- **Solution**: Ensure migration `20250802111231` was applied first
- **Verification**: Check `pg_proc` for function existence

**Issue**: "Some users not found"
- **Solution**: Normal if users don't exist in all tables
- **Action**: Review logs, verify which users existed

**Issue**: "Verification shows users still exist"
- **Solution**: Re-run deletion script (idempotent)
- **Action**: Check for database replication lag

### Getting Help
- Review `USER_DELETION_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions
- Check `DELETION_SUMMARY.md` for technical details
- Review `audit_logs` table for execution details
- Contact database administrator if issues persist
